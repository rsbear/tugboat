ðŸŽ‰ Dev Mode Implementation Complete!

What's Been Created:

1. DEV_MODE.md - A comprehensive plan document covering architecture, implementation details, usage instructions, and development phases.
2. Backend: devmode.rs - Complete Rust module with:
â—¦  File watching using the notify crate
â—¦  Dev mode session management
â—¦  Integration with existing bundler system
â—¦  Real-time event emission for status and logs
â—¦  Debounced rebuild triggers
â—¦  Proper resource cleanup
3. Frontend: app_devmode.js - Complete JavaScript module with:
â—¦  Dev command parsing (alias:dev)
â—¦  Real-time log display with styled UI
â—¦  Event handling for build status and progress
â—¦  Auto-remounting of updated apps
â—¦  Clean error handling and user feedback
4. System Integration:
â—¦  Updated lib.rs to register dev mode commands and manager
â—¦  Modified app_input.js to handle dev mode commands
â—¦  Enhanced app_preferences.js with dev mode documentation
â—¦  Added notify dependency to Cargo.toml
â—¦  Updated index.html with necessary script imports

Key Features:

âœ… Live File Watching - Monitors clone directories for changes
âœ… Automatic Rebuilding - Triggers on file saves with debouncing
âœ… Real-time Logs - Streams build output to frontend UI
âœ… Hot Remounting - Auto-swaps updated apps without page refresh
âœ… Error Handling - Graceful failure recovery and user feedback
âœ… Clean Architecture - Non-invasive integration with existing systems

How to Use:

1. Setup: Ensure clones are configured in preferences with aliases
2. Activate: Type myapp:dev in the input field (where myapp is your clone alias)
3. Develop: Make changes to files in the clone directory
4. Watch: See real-time build logs and automatic app updates
5. Deactivate: Type any other command or clear the input

Next Steps:

The implementation is ready for integration and testing. The plan document includes comprehensive testing strategies and implementation phases for iterative development.
